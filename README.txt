Project 2 starter code
======================

In this project, you're going to use the Apache Thrift RPC framework
to build a Dropbox-like cloud storage system.  You can use any language
supported by Thrift (assuming that language is also supported on the
provided servers--if it is missing, please let the TAs know and we'll
try to get it installed for you).

Because each of the different langugaes has different ways of building
the software, we have a simple script to build the code: build.sh

Also, because each language has its own way of starting up a program,
we've provided you with three shell scripts used to start up the
client, the blockserver, and the metadata server.

Note: these scripts are provided to get you going--there might be
bugs in them, and if you find any such bugs, please let us know so
we can fix and update this code.
